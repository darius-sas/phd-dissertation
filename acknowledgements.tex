\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

When I started my PhD in 2018 some of the other PhD students were finishing theirs.
This gave me the opportunity to go through their dissertations and get a sneak peak of what was expected of me.
As one could imagine, their work was outstanding and, most impressively, of the highest scientific standard.
Immediately, I thought to myself that I would never be able to achieve something like that.

After four years I can say for certain that I was indeed right -- I would have never finished this journey alone!
Therefore, I would like to spend the next few paragraphs to express my most sincere gratitude to all the people who supported me.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my two supervisors, Prof. Paris Avgeriou and Prof. Francesca Arcelli.
Dear Paris, I could not ask for a better supervisor and I am deeply honored that you were my mentor. Your way of thinking and approaching science has helped me not only becoming a better researcher, but also becoming a better person. 
I wish I could be half as good of a scientist as you are, but I will be happy even being half as good as you think of me.

Dear Francesca, .
