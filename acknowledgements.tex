% When i started my phd adventure a few students were finishing up theirs and defending their thesis. After looking at their dissertation, I said to myself that I would never be able to do something like that by myself. That i did not have the skills nor the will to stick to such a high scientific standard.
% After 4 years I now realise that I was indeed right, and that without the help of the people around me, I would have failed miserably.
% Therefore, I would like to sincerely thank all of the people who supported me through this journey.
% The person who supported me the most through this difficult journey was my supervisor, Prof. Paris Avgeriou.
% I cannot express in words how much he helped me, both practically and as a model of scientist.


% Dedication to Paris
% Thank you for being the guiding light of my phd journey (or something like this)
