% Cover details: The geometric forms on the front and back side of the cover refer to two different implementations of similar features of a robotic face. This is an analogy to the possibility of having different instantiations of one same design pattern, which may express different levels of one or more quality attributes. The curve delineated by a dark shade of red is an analogy to measurements quality levels in a time series. Finally, the font used in the cover is named \textit{Roboto}, by Christian Robertson.
