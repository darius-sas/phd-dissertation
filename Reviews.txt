I enjoyed much reading this work. It is superb!

I offer below a set of recommended improvements that can be all considered of small significance to the thesis, although they would enhance the quality (esp. regarding to its presentation) of the submitted manuscript.

[DONE] Sometimes you refer to "Open Source", sometimes to "open source", sometimes "open-source", others "open source software", and finally "OSS". Choose one and be consistent throughout the thesis

[DONE] Usually there is no space between a word and the footnote. In the manuscript, sometimes there is no space, sometimes there is a space.

[DONE] In English, commas (not dots) are used to separate numbers (usually those greater than 999)

Prof Dr A. Capiluppi
as a spoiler alert, I would like to ask the candidate the following questions
* the future work/deployment seems quite promising, what are the next low-hanging fruits that can be <easily> accomplished using the results from RQ5 and RQ6?
Answer: The low-hanging fruit is to study the impact of AS on Security. Is the presence of architectural smells a sign of more security vulnerabilities in the affected components?

* the "metaphor" of technical debt is discussed only briefly, and the latest studies that have been evaluated to discuss its limitations are from 2013. Does that mean that after that study noone has discussed whether the metaphor can be applied, or that the metaphor is actually fine as is?
Answer: TD is a metaphor that allows people with different background to comprehend common problems of software development.
Since it's a metaphor, and not a framework or a standard, it inherently has shortcomings -- so Schmid's critic is still valid.
However, being able to use a term to name a problem is a powerful cognitive instrument that allows us to better communicate and think about the problem.
Trying to quantify it and measure it is beyond the metaphor. 
Moreover, for a metaphor to be powerful it must to be simple.

1. The use of acronyms
I performa personal crusade against the use of Acronyms in academic writing. It makes texts aa lot harder to read for people not in the field. And even for people in the field sometimes. We have good coding practices of using meaningfull identifiers in source code because we know how much it contributes to the comprhensibility. And then we don't kjeep the same standards for writing prose.

In particular.
 - TD for me is the abbreviation of "Té Dansant"
 - AS is the brand name of a big shopping chain here in Belgium.

See each time I read this my brain must stop for a millisecond to reprogram what it has been trained for decades.


2. Hyperref links
        For the moment, you have all hyperref links coloured. I read most papers and Phd on-line and all this colours are really annoying.
        You can easily turn off hyperlinks colouring like this
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks,%
    citecolor=black,%
    filecolor=black,%
    linkcolor=black,%
    urlcolor=gray,
    linktocpage=true,
    bookmarks=true,
    bookmarksopen=true,
    pdfpagemode=UseOutlines,
    pdftitle={XXX},    % title
    pdfauthor={XXX},     % author
    pdfsubject={XXX},   % subject of the document
    pdfcreator={PDF LaTex},   % creator of the document
}
