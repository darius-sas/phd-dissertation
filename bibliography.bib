  abstract  = {By surveying recommendation systems in software development, we found that existing approaches have been focusing on "you might like what similar developers like" scenarios. However structured artifacts and semantically well-defined development activities bear large potentials for further recommendation scenarios. We introduce a novel "landscape" of software development recommendation systems and line out several scenarios for knowledge sharing and collaboration. Basic challenges are improving context-awareness and particularly addressing information providers.},

Productivity was studied front both a functional and a product size perspectives. Our study has highlighted a few factors that are related to either aspect of productivity. The results may provide software managers with support for evaluating and improving software processes, so they can make decisions based on more quantitative information.},

Without assistance, developers can become bogged down and spend a disproportionate amount of their time seeking information at the expense of other value-producing tasks. Recommendation systems for software engineering (RSSEs) are software tools that can assist developers with a wide range of activities, from reusing code to writing effective bug reports. The authors provide an overview of recommendation systems for software engineering: what they are, what they can do for developers, and what they might do in the future. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
