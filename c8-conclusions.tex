\section{Future Work}


% From ATD paper
% Concerning future work, we identified several opportunities. The first one is to add support for C/C++ systems by expanding the data set of the ML model with C/C++ systems, as \textsc{Arcan} already supports the detection of AS for these systems.
% Another future work opportunity is to improve the estimations as highlighted in Section \ref{c6:sec:general-feedback}, namely extend the ML model with more features and consider special cases such as cycles in the class hierarchy layers.
% Finally, we plan to complement the estimation of the principal with the estimation of the interest -- i.e. the cost of maintaining the current solution.
% This was also requested by some of our interviewees who understood that in order to take a refactoring decision, they also require to know the cost of keeping the system as is.
