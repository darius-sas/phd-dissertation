# PhD Dissertation

This repository contains the $\LaTeX$ source code of my PhD dissertation. 
I obtained my PhD in 2022 at the University of Groningen and under the supervision of Prof. [Paris Avgeriou](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/), to whom I'm eternally grateful.

You can find the compiled PDF [here](https://darius-sas.github.io/research/thesis/dissertation.pdf). Alternatively, the University of Groningen provides the official [webpage](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/managing-technical-debt-prioritising-and-quantifying-architectura) where you can download it.
